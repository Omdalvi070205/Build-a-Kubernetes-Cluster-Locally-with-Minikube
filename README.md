# DevOps Internship - Task 5: Kubernetes Cluster with Minikube
## Objective
The main goal of this task is to gain practical experience in deploying and managing applications within a Kubernetes environment.
By using Minikube to create a local cluster, I will learn the fundamental concepts and commands necessary for a DevOps role.
### Tools Used
Minikube: A tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally.
kubectl: The command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.
Docker: Used to build and manage the container images for the application.
#### Deliverables
deployment.yaml file for the application.service.yaml file to expose the application.Screenshots demonstrating the creation of pods and services.
#### Steps Performed
Minikube Setup: Installed Minikube and started a local Kubernetes cluster.
Application Deployment: Created a deployment.yaml file to define a deployment for a sample application.Service Exposure: Created a service.yaml file to expose the application using a Kubernetes service.
##### Verification:
Used kubectl get pods and kubectl get services to confirm that the pods and services were created successfully.Scaling: Practiced scaling the deployment to run multiple replicas of the application using kubectl scale.
##### Troubleshooting:
Used kubectl describe to inspect the logs and details of pods and services.OutcomeThis task has provided me with a solid understanding of basic Kubernetes concepts, including pods, deployments, and services. I now have hands-on experience with kubectl commands and the process of deploying, managing, and scaling a containerized application within a local Kubernetes cluster.
